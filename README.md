# CUTTER (for Mac only right now)

The best way to make clips of video / audio on your Mac. Simply select the video and audio input and hit record. The options are:

VIDEO:
- Full Screen
- Screen selection (like a screenshot, but will record that section of your screen)
- Webcam
- None

AUDIO:
- System audio (intercepts the sound as it is leaving your computer. Able to even record sounds when listening to a song with headphones)
- Microphone
- None

These will be able to mixed and matched however you want.
